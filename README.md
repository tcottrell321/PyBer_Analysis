# PyBer_Analysis
This analysis looked at ride sharing data across multiple cities within which PyBer operates. The data came in the form of 2 CVS files providing 4 months of data. The data contained information on rides, drivers, fares, cities, and type of city (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). 

A full analysis complete with graphs, plots, and summary tables is contained in the pdf file contained in this repository titled PyBer Analysis Challenge 5.
